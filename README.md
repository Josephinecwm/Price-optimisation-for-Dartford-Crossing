# Price optimisation for Dartford-Crossing - revenue management and pricing

The Dartford Crossing is a major road crossing of the River Thames and belongs to one of the busiest highways M25 in England. Currently, the Crossing charges a single price based on different vehicle types from 6am - 10pm and the charges apply everyday including weekends and bank holidays. 

This project aims to explore how the use of dynamic programming and optimal capacity allocation can help Dartford Crossing to achieve three different objectives: 1) revenue maximisation 2) emission minimisation 3) throughput maximisation. In this project, two strategies are proposed in order to achieve the objectives: 1) Time-based differentiation by vehicle type through Peak-Period Pricing; 2) Capacity allocation of high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes based on vehicle occupancy.
